# Object-Detection-on-Coil20-unproc-datast
**In this project, i have created a python script that works on coil20 unproc dataset.**
**The dataset contain 5 types of object and splitted tha dataset in 3 parts train,test and validate. Each part has 5 directories for each object.**
**The train part contain 40 images , test and validation part contains 15, 15 images.**
**Then we build a convolutional neural network. In this cnn i use the activation function as 'relu.**
**I have used Categorical crossentropy as a  Loss function.**
**Then data preprocessing will be done and run 5 epochs.**
**Tested on single random image.**
